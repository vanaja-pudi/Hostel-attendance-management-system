# Hostel-attendance-management-system
Developed a portable smart hostel attendance management system which is handy and self-powered.
The main purpose of this project is to build a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system for Hostel management to enhance and upgrade the current attendance system into more
efficient and effective as compared to before. 
 The current old system has a lot of ambiguity that caused inaccurate and inefficient of attendance taking. 
 Many problems arise when the authority is unable to enforce the regulation that exist in the old system. 
The technology working behind will be the face recognition system. The human face is one of the natural traits that can uniquely identify an individual.
Therefore, it is used to trace identity as the possibilities for a face to deviate or being duplicated is low.
In this project, face databases will be created to pump data into the recognizer algorithm. 
Then, during the attendance taking session, faces will be compared against the database to seek for identity.
When an individual is identified, its attendance will be taken down automatically saving necessary information into a excel sheet. 
At the end of the day, the excel sheet containing attendance information regarding all individuals are downloaded.
                   
    The objectives of the project:
           ▪ To develop a portable Smart Hostel Attendance System which is handy and self-powered.
           ▪ To ensure the speed of the attendance recording process is faster than the previous system which can go as fast as approximately 10 second for each student.
           ▪ Have enough memory space to store the database.
           ▪ Able to recognize the face of an individual accurately based on the face      database.
           ▪ Develop a database for the attendance management system.
           ▪Allow new students or staff to store their faces in the database by using a GUI.
           ▪Able to show an indication to the user whether the face-recognition process is successful or not.
           ▪There is no chance of manipulation
